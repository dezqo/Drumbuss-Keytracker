# Drumbuss Keytracker
A small Max4Live device.

## What is this and how do I use it?
This device is meant to be used with Live 10's Drumbuss device!
Just click on "Map" and then select "Freq" on the Drumbuss device.
It is meant to be used with monophonic instruments, the glide dial enables gliding between notes!

## Important Information
Only works from the note B-1 up to F1, because that's the current range of the Drumbuss device.
